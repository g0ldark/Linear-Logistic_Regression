## What You've Learned

In the "Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification" course! Here's a brief summary of the key concepts and skills you've acquired:

1. **Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning**: The course began with an introduction to the fundamentals of supervised machine learning, providing an overview of the course objectives and its structure.

2. **Linear Regression**: You delved into the world of linear regression, a fundamental technique used for predicting numerical values. You learned to build and evaluate linear regression models.

3. **Logistic Regression**: The course then focused on logistic regression, a powerful tool for solving binary classification problems. You explored the logistic function and its applications in real-world scenarios.

4. **Hands-On Coding Exercises**: You gained practical experience by working on coding exercises using Python, NumPy, and scikit-learn. This hands-on approach helped solidify your understanding of the course material.

5. **Model Evaluation**: In the final part of the course, you learned how to assess and evaluate the performance of machine learning models using a variety of metrics. You gained insights into the importance of model evaluation in the real-world application of machine learning.

With these skills and knowledge, you're well-equipped to apply supervised machine learning techniques to solve practical problems and make data-driven decisions.
